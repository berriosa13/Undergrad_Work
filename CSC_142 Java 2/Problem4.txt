The program runs howver it dispays the wrong student if multiple people scored a seven.
The last person to get a seven is printed out instead of the first
putting the for loop inside of a while loop owuld solve this problem.
The while loop would stop once it has gone through every student. it would then output who
scored a 7 if anyone.
