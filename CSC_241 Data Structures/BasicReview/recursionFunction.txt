*To get this output we must figure out what the values
 are for f(M,N,O,P) for "x" we can assume x = 3
 as the first column of output has not changed. for "a" the value
 must be 3 as well because the values of the first two is 3. b is equal to 4
 and c is equal to 5. Therefore f(M,N,O,P) = f(3,3,4,5,)
